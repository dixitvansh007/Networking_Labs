### Networking Lab - 1

#### OBJECTIVE: 
To capture packets of data across your network using Wireshark.

#### PRE-REQUISITES: 
Wireshark software installed.

#### DURATION: 
30 min

#### STEPS:
•	Open Wireshark software and select the network connection on your system.

•	In the command prompt, ping “google.com” and check Wireshark thereafter for echo request and echo reply.

•	Try pinging an ip that does not exist on your network, and look for ARP data.

•	Also, try pinging any other ip or domain name, or any other web-activity in a browser, and click the Stop button.

•	You can also filter different protocols in the search bar, to look for data flow across the network using the respective protocols.

#### CONCLUSION:  
This lab aims at understanding and helping to visualise the flow of packet data across our network using the Wireshark software. It builds a strong foundation of our learning in different protocols, and how our device connects on our network with different devices, as well as on the other networks.
