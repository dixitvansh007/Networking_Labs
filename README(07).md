### Networking Lab - 7

#### OBJECTIVE: 
To practice subnetting and create Two LANs on different subnets.
#### PRE-REQUISITES: 
Cisco packet tracer software installed.
#### DURATION: 
30 min

#### STEPS:

•	Start the packet tracer file included (Lab-4 Start), and have a look at the configuration.

•	The two different LANs need to be on a different subnet. Utilise /25 CIDR class C network to label the devices with the respective ip addresses.

•	Next, configure the devices in the IP configuration of the devices.

•	Verify the connectivity by pinging one PC from the other.

#### CONCLUSION:  
This lab brings the opportunity to brush up and practice the concepts of subnetting, while also applying them in a practical manner, using a topology of two LANs.
