### Networking Lab - 3 

#### OBJECTIVE: 
    1. To assign static IPs to different PCs on a basic LAN.
                            
    2. Check IP configuration using IPCONFIG command.

    3. Test connectivity using PING or PDUs.
#### PRE-REQUISITES: 
Cisco packet tracer software installed.
#### DURATION: 
30 min

#### STEPS:

•	Start the packet tracer file included (Lab-3 Start), and have a look at the configuration.

•	The switch has a class C network (192.168.100.0), which is going to be the network being used in this lab.

•	Using a CIDR notation of /24, go to each individual PCs and assign them a network with an increment of 10.

•	Go to each desktop and select command prompt.

•	Type “ipconfig” and verify the ip addresses on respective PCs.

•	To test the connectivity, go to any one of the PC’s command prompt, and ping other PCs.

•	Another way is going to simulation mode, and add a simple PDU.

•	Hit forward button to have a visualisation of packet flowing from PC to switch and forward.

#### CONCLUSION:  
This lab shows how static IPs are assigned to different devices on a network, their connectivity is tested using “ping” command, and also a good way to visualise packets flow across the network using the simulation mode.
